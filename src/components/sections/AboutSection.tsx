                <strong>I'm a finance leader, still curious and focused after all those years;</strong> Whether the challenges have 
                been creating performance management capabilities, business improvements and turnarounds, M&A 
                integrations and strategic initiatives - always with strong focus on what and how we can make a real 
                difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>With a strong financial toolbox and business acumen,</strong> I connect and de-risk value 
                drivers, identify opportunities, find solutions with a <strong>laser focus on value creation</strong>, and consistently 
                champion a profitable growth mindset across organizations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>I'm direct and open-minded, not afraid to challenge status quo constructively.</strong> I give people the 
                chance to shine rather than hide them in my shadow.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Now I'm building FinancialDecisionModels.com</strong> because after two decades of wrestling with 
                complex, unintuitive models that often gave precisely the wrong results, I know there's a better wayâ€¦
