                    My name is <strong>Palle Fl√∏e Nielsen</strong> and I'm based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>I'm a finance leader, still curious and focused after all those years;</strong> Whether the challenges have 
                    been creating performance management capabilities, business improvements and turnarounds, M&A 
                    integrations and strategic initiatives - always with strong focus on what and how we can make a real 
                    difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>With a strong financial toolbox and business acumen,</strong> I connect and de-risk value 
                    drivers, identify opportunities, find solutions with a <strong>laser focus on value creation</strong>, and consistently 
                    champion a profitable growth mindset across organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>I'm direct and open-minded, not afraid to challenge status quo constructively.</strong> I give people the 
                    chance to shine rather than hide them in my shadow.

                    Why I Built FinancialDecisionModels.com
                  </h2>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    After two decades of wrestling with complex, unintuitive models that often gave precisely the wrong results, I knew there had to be a better way.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>The problem was clear:</strong> Most financial models are either oversimplified templates or overly complex black boxes that obscure rather than enable decision-making. Business leaders need tools that are sophisticated enough to be credible, yet intuitive enough to actually use.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>My solution:</strong> Create a best-in-class, business-minded Financial Decision Model toolbox that turns complex financial choices into structured insights and better decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>But it's not just about the tools.</strong> I also want to inspire and help you make better financial models yourself. That's why I've made the models widely available - some freely viewable in your browser, others available as downloads.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>The balance of access and protection</strong> is something I continue to refine. For now, check out the <Link to="/how-it-works" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">"How It Works"</Link> page to see the current approach.

                    The Inspiration behind the Logo

                      The logo is inspired by the Knud Rasmussen statue north of Copenhagen, where the explorer stands tall, gazing toward distant horizons. Knud Rasmussen was a Greenlandic-Danish anthropologist who famously explored the Arctic and studied Inuit cultures. The statue is a monument to exploration, understanding, and bridge-building to unknown geographical and cultural territories.
