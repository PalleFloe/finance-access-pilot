                    My name is <strong>Palle Fl√∏e Nielsen</strong> and I'm based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>I'm a finance leader, still curious and focused after all those years;</strong> Whether the challenges have 
                    been creating performance management capabilities, business improvements and turnarounds, M&A 
                    integrations and strategic initiatives - always with strong focus on what and how we can make a real 
                    difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>With a strong financial toolbox and business acumen,</strong> I connect and de-risk value 
                    drivers, identify opportunities, find solutions with a <strong>laser focus on value creation</strong>, and consistently 
                    champion a profitable growth mindset across organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>I'm direct and open-minded, not afraid to challenge status quo constructively.</strong> I give people the 
                    chance to shine rather than hide them in my shadow.

                    Why I founded Financial Decision Models
                  </h2>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    After two decades of wrestling with complex, unintuitive models that often gave precisely the wrong results, I knew there had to be a better way.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>The problem was clear:</strong> Most financial models are either oversimplified templates or overly complex black boxes that obscure rather than enable decision-making. Business leaders need tools that are sophisticated enough to be credible, yet intuitive enough to actually use.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>My solution:</strong> Create a best-in-class, business-minded Financial Decision Model toolbox that turns complex financial choices into structured insights and better business decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>But it's not just about the tools.</strong> I also want to inspire and help you make better financial models yourself. That's why I've made the models widely available - some freely viewable in your browser, others available as downloads.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-garamond">
                    <strong>The balance of access and protection</strong> is something I continue to refine. For now, check out the <Link to="/how-it-works" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">"How It Works"</Link> page to see the current approach.

                    The Inspiration behind the Logo
                  </h4>

                    <p>
                      The logo is inspired by the Knud Rasmussen statue north of Copenhagen, where the explorer stands tall, gazing toward distant horizons. Knud Rasmussen was a Greenlandic-Danish anthropologist who famously explored the Arctic and studied Inuit cultures. The statue is a monument to exploration, understanding, and bridge-building to unknown geographical and cultural territories.
