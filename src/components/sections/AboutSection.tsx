                    I'm still curious and focused after all these years. I have a strong focus on what and how we can create real value. I'm direct, open-minded, and not afraid to challenge the status quo constructively.

                    The Problem I'm Trying to Help Solve
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    I have participated in many important business decisions over the years. These often became very long processes, with wasteful use of resources, and overly complex models that often gave 'precisely the wrong results'. I realized the need for better solutions.

                  <p>
                    Business leaders need decision tools that are sophisticated enough to be credible, yet intuitive enough to actually use.

                    About the Free Models
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    To demonstrate my methodology, I offer a range of professional financial decision models completely free:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                    <li>Free to view online - no registration required.</li>
                    <li>Download and use after simple registration. Use them as designed for your analysis.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    All models are standard safe Excel files without macros, hosted on Microsoft SharePoint. Formulas are protected to prevent accidental changes, but all input cells are fully editable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you need implementation for your specific situation - whether that's adapting these models or building something custom - that's where consulting comes in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your input and perspectives on the website, the models, or any related topics would be incredibly helpful. Please email me at <a href="mailto:feedback@financialdecisionmodels.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">feedback@financialdecisionmodels.com</a>.

                      The logo is inspired by the Knud Rasmussen statue north of Copenhagen, where the explorer stands tall, gazing toward distant horizons. Knud Rasmussen was a Greenlandic-Danish anthropologist who famously explored the Arctic and studied Inuit cultures. The statue is a monument to exploration, understanding, and bridge-building to unknown geographical and cultural territories.
