                  <p>
                    My name is <strong>Palle Floe Nielsen</strong> and I'm based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>I'm a finance leader, still curious and focused after all those years;</strong> Whether the challenges have 
                    been creating performance management capabilities, business improvements and turnarounds, M&A 
                    integrations and strategic initiatives - always with strong focus on what and how we can make a real 
                    difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>With a strong financial toolbox and business acumen,</strong> I connect and de-risk value 
                    drivers, identify opportunities, find solutions with a <strong>laser focus on value creation</strong>, and consistently 
                    champion a profitable growth mindset across organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>I'm direct and open-minded, not afraid to challenge status quo constructively.</strong> I give people the 
                    chance to shine rather than hide them in my shadow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Now I'm building FinancialDecisionModels.com</strong> because after two decades of wrestling with 
                    complex, unintuitive models that often gave precisely the wrong results, I know there's a better wayâ€¦
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The purpose is to empower businesses facing complex financial choices to make better 
                    decisions</strong> with a best-in-class, intuitive, business-minded Financial Decision Model toolbox and expert consulting 
                    services.

                      Our logo draws inspiration from the Knud Rasmussen monument north of Copenhagen, where the explorer stands tall, gazing toward distant horizons. Just as Rasmussen charted unknown Arctic territories and bridged distant cultures, Financial Decision Models guides you through uncharted financial decisions, transforming complex and risky choices into clear pathways forward.
